# sticky-notes-clone

A basic lightweight sticky notes program. 
This program is straightforward to use. 

The supported os-systems should be (I haven't tested all of these):
* Up to Windows 10
* macOS
* Linux

If you want to delete individual notes, you should use the built-in delete button.

To delete all program files, locate your computer's primary document directory and delete the `StickyNotes notes` folder.
