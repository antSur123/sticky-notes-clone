# sticky-notes-clone

A basic lightweight sticky notes program. 
This program is straightforward to use. 

The supported os-systems should be (I haven't tested all of these):
* Up to Windows 10
* macOS
* Linux

If you want to delete individual notes, you should use the built-in delete button.

To delete all program files, locate your computer's primary document directory and delete the `StickyNotes notes` folder.


Every time you run the program, it will look for the `StickyNotes notes` folder in your computer's main document folder. If it can't find it, it will create the directory.
In the `StickyNotes notes` folder, there will be two essential files the program will ensure are there. The `default.snote` and the `last.snote.inf`.
